# Stock Screener

> Stock Screener SPA

<!-- ![screenshot](screenshot-mobile.png) -->

This project is a stock screener SPA built as my React capstone at Microverse. Users can view stock data for selected markets and access company quotes.

It is built with React and Redux, implements the Financial Modeling Prep API, and is tested with React Testing Library and Mock Service Worker.

# Project Highlights

### - Built with React's reusability principle in mind

| `Home` component | `Symbol` component |

### - Uses component composition via a component I custom-built components to manage flexbox structures

| `HightlightCard` component | Reusable `SplitPane` component |

### - Data fetching and loading from API is managed using thunk lifecycle actions via `createAsyncThunk`

### - Testing API calls is made at the network level with proper mocking using Mock Service Worker

_I wrote a blog article about it: [Testing React Components with API Calls and Redux Store](https://www.akasharojee.codes/2021/09/04/testing-react-components-with-api-calls-and-redux-store.html)_

### - Customised React Testing Library's `render` method so that tests can access real Redux store and logic and use actual app behaviour

_See blog article above._
